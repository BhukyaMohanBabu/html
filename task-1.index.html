Rishabh Pant was born on 4 October 1997 in <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roorkee">Roorkee, Uttarakhand </a>, India to Rajendra Pant and Saroj Pant. At the age of 12, Pant would travel with his mother to Delhi during the weekends to train with Tarak Sinha at the Sonnet Cricket Academy. He and his mother stayed at a Gurdwara in Moti Bagh as they did not have suitable accommodation in the city.

Sinha suggested Pant switch to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan">  Rajasthan </a>to play U-13 and U-15 cricket but to no avail. Pant was instructed by his mentor to overhaul his entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)">batting technique</a> in the hopes of becoming a better batsman.His turning point came when he was playing U-19 cricket for Delhi against Assam. Pant had top-scored with 35 in his first innings and then hit 150 in the second innings, which he claims was the most important knock in his career.

On 1 February 2016, during the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Under-19_Cricket_World_Cup"> 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup</a>, Pant hit an 18-ball fifty against Nepal, the fastest at this level.
